# Why Ka?

There just no any reasons (except of lack of stable compiler implementation (any compiler implementation, actually), standard library, LSP's, debuggers, versioning, and even a language standard, actually) to don't use Ka as a foundation of your next long term project with your team.

# Language

### Design inspirations

Ka language design is highly inspired by syntax of Rust language.

### Functionality

As we know, Rust language removed all annoying excess functionality from C++ (object-oriented-like classes, exceptions, etc.), so Ka language went event further and removed all annoying excess functionality from Rust (traits, borrow checking, etc.).

### Just fun fact

This improvements actually resulted a fun thing: Ka language is quite same with C with dietic portion of syntactic sugar added.

# Standard library

There is no standard library for Ka language yet :(

# Compiler

There is 3 Ka compiler implementations planned.

### KLC-RS

Rust and LLVM - based implementation of Ka compiler, is under active development.

### KLC-C

C-based implementation, will be built as a .....

### KLC

Main, Ka-based implementation, is not even planned yet.
