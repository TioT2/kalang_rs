Create defined/undefined symbol table for proper AST type lowering symbol resolving

Check AST for doing TIR work ('forgetting' about symbols with duplicate names, as example)

Do something with AST and Lexer error handling (e.g. fix comb crate)

Move 'if' and 'while' constructions to expression from statement
    Somehow learn to parse not semicolon-terminated expressions

Transform lexer to stream (abstract slice by streams, spans, etc.)
